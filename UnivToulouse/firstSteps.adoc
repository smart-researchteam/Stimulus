=== Create a new `project`

The first step is to create a new project.
To do so, Click the btn:[New project] located in
the toolbar or open the menu:File[] and select `New Project`. 
A pop-up window appears to configure basic project properties, as shown in <<newp>>.

Name your project `{caseStudy}`, for example.

TIP:  You can set the project name in the `Name` field, and define your working directory in the `Location` field. 
Then click btn:[OK] to finish. 
Your project now appears in the `Projects` tab as shown in <<editor>>. 
The project tree will allow you to manage your project models just like a file system would do.

=== Create a new `package`

Projects can be organised hierarchically with `packages`, that contain editable model elements such as requirements, glossaries, etc. 
To create a package, select the parent directory or package in your project tree (the `src` forlder), then open the main menu:File[New > Package] as shown in <<pack>>. 

TIP: As a rule in {stimulus}, you can also right-click to perform the same action from the contextual menu. 

When created, the new package is selected and editable, which allows you to rename it. 
If you want to rename it later, you need to select it by clicking on it, then clicking again after a short delay to make it editable.

=== Create a new `system`

To add a system into the newly created package, select it and choose menu:File[New > System] in the menu (see <<system>>).

TIP: A `system` can be seen as "anything with ports (inputs/outputs)".

[{topic}]
=== Create a new `port`

Once the system is created, you can define the interface with its environment by declaring a list of
named ports (Input and output signals). 
To declare a port, click the btn:[plus shaped] next to the ports label in the `Interface` panel on the right side of the window. 
A new port appears in the corresponding section that can be renamed as shown in <<port>>.

=== Perform your first simulation
 
Your newly created system is ready for simulation, even if it is still empty! 
To launch the simulation of a selected system tab, press the btn:[Play] button (image:btn-run.png[width=30]). 
The Simulation screen appears on the lowest part of the window (see <<play>>).

TIP: To have a better view on the simulation, you can "detach" the panel from the tool, by right-clicking on the panel and select menu:Undock[].

[{topic}]
=== Then play with the simulation pad (Simulate buttons)

You can play with the simulation interface (e.g., <<simulation>>), or if you want to learn the simulation interface, go to <<sec:simulation>>.

NOTE: Since there is no specified requirement in this system, {stimulus} will choose a random value within the range of possible values. 
Moreover, since no data type has been specified for the port, then {stimulus} will assume a numeric type and it will choose a value between minus infinity and plus infinity.
